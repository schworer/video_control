# video_control

This is a demo-quality node.js app that enables a Mobile Safari client to control the playback of video running in connected browsers. On the server side, it uses the express framework for serving html and the socket.io module for communication between client and server. On the client side, jquery for desktop browsers and jQTouch for the mobile client.

 * The timing is generally all messed up.
 * Might want to look into implementing the rv sync messaging protocol, instead of my half baked system.
 * Make the desktop client look halfway decent.
 * Slider bar for scrubbing in the iPhone client.
